## Usage

I'm not uploading the data to github, because it would be too big. Plus, I made Claude do most of the heavy lifting (for around $5), so there will probably be a bit of noise if you try to exactly re-run my analysis scripts. 

You can do either by running `bash src/process_data/setup_data.sh` and following the instructions.

Once `processed-bios.json` exists in `data/processed/`, you can then open `main.html` with your favorite live server extension (I like [this one](https://open-vsx.org/extension/ms-vscode/live-server)) and you're all set.

## todos:

- [x] make circle size grow dynamically with the number of paths that go through it
- [x]  make it so that there's a `house` end node and a `senate` end node
- [ ] rearrange dots for better spacing (ongoing)
- [ ] add background lines
- [x]  make it so that when you hover over a path, you highlight all the (labeled) nodes that the path goes through 
  - [ ] probably means making all extant paths dimmer?
- [x] add invisible control nodes to reduce path overlap
- [x] give all the democrats positive offsets and the republicans negative offsets to make the sorting look nicer at each node
- [x] get the paths to actually center at each node (this might have to be manual-er in final product â€” e.g. `customPublicCollegeCirclePlacement`)
- [x] decrease spacing and path thickness so full version doesn't take up the entire screen 
- [ ] let you search by individual, party, state
  
- [x] build pipeline to let claude parse bios into the relevant json format (important for going through the thousands of congresspeople from prev years)
